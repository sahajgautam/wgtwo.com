Atos and Working Group Two (wgtwo) are teaming up to provide operators with a simplified, end-to-end mobile network solution. It is based on wgtwo’s 4/5G cloud-native mobile core and on Atos’s full Next Generation Telecom Network portfolio, including cloud computing, edge and Open RAN technologies. Atos and wgtwo will jointly deliver “core-network-as-a-service” solutions.

This collaboration will target related core opportunities such as IoT, Private Network and Enterprise for the Tier 1 operators, while also extending the offering to public MNO core networks for Tier 2, Tier 3. The solution will enable operators to optimize capacity, improve time to market, lower costs and simplify operations.

Operators can connect their radio networks to the wgtwo global core network. The wgtwo platform is a G-neutral platform that allows for a converged experience with national roaming on 2G/3G and full MNO or private network functionality for 4G/5G. The platform offers the full capabilities of a MNO core related to authentication and provisioning, policy, voice, messaging, data services and all the surrounding orchestration, operational and management tools.

Jean-Claude Geha, Head of Telecom, Media and Technology at Atos, said:
>  As mobile networks are getting more and more complex, operators need to simplify and rationalize their infrastructure. To go through this transformation, Cloud Computing and Network Functions Virtualization are key technologies for operators to deliver a simpler and more reliable network, with a faster time-to-market and tailored managed services. I am pleased to join forces with a new and innovative player such as Working Group Two to tackle this challenge.

Erlend Prestgard, CEO of Working Group Two, said: 
> Atos and WGTWO’s end-to-end solution delivers simplicity, lower costs and enable operators to innovate continuously.
