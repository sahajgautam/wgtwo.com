HONOLULU (Hawaiʻi) and OSLO (Norway), January 17, 2023 - Mobi, a leading wireless provider in Hawaiʻi, is now expanding into the continental United States and beyond. [Mobi](https://www.mobi.com) is one of only four full mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs) in the United States, where they will leverage America’s leading 5G network, with no territorial restrictions. A pilot solution goes live today.

To support a cost-effective, scalable and innovation-friendly expansion strategy, Mobi partnered with Working Group Two (WG2) to move its core network to the cloud. The WG2 mobile core runs cloud-natively on Amazon Web Services [(AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com/telecom/) and empowers Mobi to build a compelling, app-first customer experience on the largest 5G nationwide network. 

By choosing a scalable and flexible cloud architecture, Mobi can offer more competitive rates and faster time-to-market with new services. The Network-as-a-Service approach reduces the time it takes to develop and deploy new features and upgrades. In contrast to legacy solutions, which include only a few network updates per year, Mobi will benefit from continuous, daily upgrades. Further, with a mobile core from WG2 that is agnostic to any generation of wireless, Mobi can future-proof its network with no end-of-life and continuous maintenance and support. 

With a programmable, cloud-native core, Mobi will gain unprecedented flexibility, and will realize significantly faster time-to-market with new services.  Once the WG2 mobile core is integrated with the radio network, Mobi can leverage simple APIs to determine which services to activate for every SIM or user. The network is delivered fully as-a-service and the cost is based on consumption, defined by the number and type of users/SIM cards, changing as needs and traffic fluctuate. This allows for lower barriers of entry, and a core network that can scale from single users to hundreds of millions of users.

Said Justen Burdette, CEO of Mobi:
> “Our ambition is to disrupt and challenge the status quo in the wireless industry by delivering a seamless, app-first, and engaging customer experience. By working with WG2 and AWS, we not only get access to a scalable, secure, and future-proof core network, we also improve our ability to meet the demands of our customers. It’s all about making it simple to join, affordable to use, and fun to explore what our network can offer. We’re building a brand that resonates with our customers by working with a strong ecosystem of partners."

Said Erlend Prestgard, CEO of WG2:
> “Mobi is a standout example of a carrier that’s ready to unlock the benefits of a network-as-a-service, achievable with a consistent, programmable mobile core running on the cloud. This allows them to go live in new geographical markets in record time. The simplicity of the as-a-service operating model means that Mobi can focus on meeting customer expectations and spend their time dreaming about innovation, rather than managing complexity. We’re truly excited about joining Mobi on this journey." 

Said Fabio Cerone, Managing Director EMEA, Telco Business Unit at AWS:
> “Embracing the cloud helps carriers simplify network operations, deploy networks more rapidly, scale more easily - while still retaining full control over the network and gaining additional agility and innovation capabilities. Now the core network is only one API away from the global community of developers, which can help deliver new value for Mobi’s customers."

As an app-first company, wholly focused on user experience, Mobi embraces an open, API-enabled core network approach. Access to WG2's global ecosystem of developers offers Mobi a selection of pre-integrated, ready-to-deploy applications for voice, messaging and data services, built by WG2’s development partners from all over the world. Following the continental U.S. rollout, Mobi also plans to leverage the same model to expand to markets including Canada, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
