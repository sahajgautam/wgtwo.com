(OSLO, NORWAY, JAN 9, 2023) – Working Group Two today announced it has joined Competitive Carriers Association (CCA) as it continues to build its presence in the United States. 

WG2 delivers a cloud-native 4G/5G core network as-a-service and as-a-platform for operators and developers. This drives the dual benefits of cost savings and revenue growth for the mobile industry. To help operators grow and differentiate, WG2 also offers a product marketplace that takes advantage of the programmable core network to create app stores of products for operators and users alike.

Erlend Prestgard, CEO of Working Group Two, said: 
> "We believe this value proposition is ideal for the many regional operators across the United States, both those having to swap their networks, and those seeking to simplify and standardize their critical network operations. This allows CCA members to not only reduce complexity and save cost but focus on meeting customer needs and differentiating with new products and services.”

As examples, some operators will want to move quickly to 5G, while others are focused on new service delivery such as multi-IMSI for watches with calls and messages. Other use cases include offering B2B products such as PBXs and customized network security products. 

WG2 has a proven track record of customer deployments in Europe, including CK Hutchison (multi-country), Telenor in Sweden and eRate in Norway. As perhaps the only vendor, it has been running its core live in the public cloud since 2018. The company is also delivering private networks in Japan in collaboration with Mitsui Knowledge Industry Co,. Ltd. KI. WG2’s global core platform and product ecosystem runs on infrastructure from Amazon Web Services (AWS). 

Tim Donovan, President and CEO of CCA, said:
> “We are delighted to welcome WG2 to CCA. CCA’s associate members play an integral role in the competitive carrier ecosystem, and WG2’s expertise and innovative solutions will certainly be a valuable addition for the entire membership.” 

[CCA](https://www.ccamobile.org) is the nation’s leading association for competitive wireless providers and stakeholders across the United States. 

WG2 will be present at the [CCA Mobile Carriers Show](https://www.ccamobile.org/cca-events#CCAEvents) in Pittsburgh, PA, May 2-4, 2023.
