description: Traditionally private networks require on-premise deployments such as PBX solutions. These integrations of radio spectrum and maintaining the infrastructure require detailed experience. Lastly, once deployed these integrations weren't evolved with later features requested by customers and not being implemented. This ultimately made it difficult for PKI to build new businesses on top of the private network domain.

    Our 5G Starter Kit selects Working Group Two, which provides a fully managed SaaS-type 5G core. Since there is no need of 5G Core related equipment, integration and construction in the customer environment, it gives a very short Time-to-Market. It also provides various APIs for developers, which can be used to create further added value for local 5G.
