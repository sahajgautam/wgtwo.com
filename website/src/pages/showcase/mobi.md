        Mobi, Inc. is a wireless carrier founded in 2004 and based in Honolulu. The company provides service on each of the major islands of Hawaiʻi. It is one of the few full MVNOs in the United States and now aims to launch its services in the mainland, under its agreement with T-Mobile. This means that Mobi will pit itself against both the large incumbents and all the regional and vertical competitors in the U.S. consumer telecom landscape.

      <Card title="SOLUTION">
        <p>By choosing WG2 as its mobile core network vendor, Mobi immediately reduced its time to market and avoided Tier-1 vendor timelines. It also obtained access to product and service differentiation capabilities.
        </p>
        <p>Mobi makes a strategic shift from legacy networks to deploy a cloud-native mobile core, fully managed as-a-Service. The 4G/5G/IMS mobile core network is deployed on infrastructure from AWS to realize a rapid commercial launch.
        </p>
        <p>By choosing a scalable and flexible cloud architecture, Mobi can offer more competitive rates and faster time-to-market with new services. The Mobile Core Network-as-a-Service approach reduces the time it takes to develop and deploy new features and upgrades. In contrast to legacy solutions, which include only a few network updates per year, Mobi will benefit from continuous, daily upgrades.</p>
