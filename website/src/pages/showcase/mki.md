description: Traditionally private networks require on-premise deployments such as PBX solutions. These integrations of radio spectrum and maintaining the infrastructure require detailed experience. Lastly, once deployed these integrations weren't evolved with later features requested by customers and not being implemented. This ultimately made it difficult for PKI to build new businesses on top of the private network domain.

        Traditionally private networks require on-premise deployments. These integrations of the radio spectrum and the maintenance of the infrastructure require detailed experience. Lastly, once deployed these integrations weren't evolved with later features requested by customers and not being implemented. This ultimately made it difficult for MKI to build new businesses on top of the private network domain.

        WG2 enabled MKI to simplify the financial and operational aspects of the mobile system allowing business growth. The cloud-based private network can be scaled with MKI’s customer portfolio. On top of it, each deployment leverages the WG2 platform to get access to VoLTE/VoNR, network APIs, a carrier grade infrastructure and a leading security, to name a few of the private network features.

    Our 5G Starter Kit leverages Working Group Two’s fully managed 5G core, delivered as-a-service. Since there is no need for 5G Core-related equipment, integration and construction in the customer environment, the time-to-market is drastically reduced. Working Group Two also provides various APIs for developers, which can be used to create further added value for local 5G services.
