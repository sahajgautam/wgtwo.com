        Through customer feedback Vimla’s customers did not want to receive phone calls from unknown contacts. Vimla wanted to provide a solution to our customers that could block these phone calls for their subscribers but wasn’t able to do this on their existing core network.

      <Card label="SOLUTION" title="An advanced API that enables Vimla to build a custom application,  allowing their customers to filter phone calls on the network level.">
        wgtwo has made a telco core service that grows as your company grows. As Vimla is a fast-growing MVNO they required such a platform to meet their customer’s demands. Through wgtwo APIs Vimla built an innovative mobile app <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/vimla-filter/id1435063008" target="_blank">apple</a> / <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.vimlafilterapp&hl=en&gl=US&pli=1" target="_blank"> android</a> to block voice calls on behalf of the telco network. This allowed Vimla to win awards as the best operator for five-plus years.
